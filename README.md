# Ego Manager
Yet another Doom launcher

# Build Instructions

After cloning or downloading the repository, simply run:
`npm install`

# Running the app

`npm start` to start the app (by default, it runs in "dev mode")
`npm run build-exe` to export the app as an executable
`npm run build-package` to build, export as an executable, AND archive the whole thing in a nice neat little .7z file.
